- url mapping :

	- pass id in the query string in category (maybe hide it?)

	- /register, /login and /logout url mapping not separate one for each

	- after url rewriting, sometimes it takes too long to load



- handling errors :
	- paypal
	- if any ajax request fails





- register need click twice to work in IE







- confirm password only in frontend (how to put confirm password in form but without sending it to server) ????






- later and optional :

	- stripe and handling errors if occured

	- multiple file uploads and renaming them

	- try different library for cropping
