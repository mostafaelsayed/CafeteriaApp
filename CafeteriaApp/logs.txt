-absolute paths to relative
done {requests, controllers, cashier, admin, customer}
remaining { js files}


-json language : ar, en

-delete and put requests are unsupported on the host(unless premium)

-test_request_intput

-angular push notifications

-check login and permissions in each page except for public dir

-delete unnecessary tables

-layouts paths in css & js are calculated as if they accessed from the caller not the layout itself


-layout in frontend is for public and customers

-any file(php, js, css) that is required inside a php file, its relative path is relative with the path of that php that included it
to solve this issue for php , we call __DIR__ to get the original parent dir but for js & css files we make the paths relative to the php

login page has redirect implemented incorrectly using post gv but the write one i think is to use session to save that info(my fault), check the url if it's internal , use access tokens

put search in home page
