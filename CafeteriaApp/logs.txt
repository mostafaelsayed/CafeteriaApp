-delete and put requests are unsupported on the host(unless premium)

login page has redirect implemented incorrectly using post gv but the write one i think is to use session to save that info(my fault), check the url if it's internal , use access tokens

-put search in home page(not cafetrias)

-avg rating is wrong

-paypal

-change password

-capatcha in register & feedback

-table of bill as fixed on the bottom right (suggest)

- update rating to make users up and logged in user down and hidden but show when press a button

-when calling favorites page, layout hader links are represented relative to the directory of customer.

*layout in frontend is for public and customers
